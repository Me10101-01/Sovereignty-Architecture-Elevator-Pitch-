**APPLY:**  
Q1.3: Given a proposal to change the charitable distribution from 7% to 10%, walk through the governance approval process.  
*Answer: Submit to board → AI deliberation → 4/5 vote → human review → cryptographic signing → implementation*

**ANALYZE:**  
Q1.4: Compare multi-AI governance to traditional corporate boards. What are the key differences in decision latency, bias, and accountability?  
*Answer: AI: instant deliberation, diverse perspectives, cryptographic accountability vs Human: slow, groupthink risk, legal accountability*

**EVALUATE:**  
Q1.5: A critical security decision needs to be made within 2 hours, but AI consensus is deadlocked 2-2-1. What should happen?  
*Answer: Human override authority, document reasoning, post-decision AI review, update constitution if pattern emerges*

**ANALYZE:**  
Q3.4: Analyze why cross-domain analogies (biology, chemistry, game theory) generate better solutions than single-domain analysis.  
*Answer: Different domains evolved different solutions to similar problems, cross-pollination reveals hidden options, breaks mental constraints*

**EVALUATE:**  
Q3.5: When should you NOT use analogical reasoning to resolve contradictions?  
*Answer: Domain-specific regulations (legal requirements), hard physics constraints, proven best practices with no variation allowed*

**CREATE:**  
Q3.6: Design a contradiction resolution workflow that uses at least 3 different domains (biology, chemistry, game theory, physics) to synthesize solutions.
