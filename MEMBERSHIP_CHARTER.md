## ⚖️ Equality Clause

### All Members Are Equal

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Money ≠ Power | A $200/month member has the same vote as a $1/month member |
| Work ≠ Power | A builder working 40 hours has the same vote as one working 4 hours |
| Tenure ≠ Power | Day-1 members have the same vote as founding members |
| One Member = One Vote | Democratic equality is non-negotiable |

**Why?** Because we're building a cooperative, not a corporation. Power comes from community, not capital.

---
