# Implementation Notes - ZVLI-2025-001

## Document Naming Convention

### "PRINCIPALS" vs "PRINCIPLES"

**Decision:** The document title uses "PRINCIPALS" (not "PRINCIPLES")

**Rationale:**
This is an intentional dual meaning in legal/governance context:
1. **Principal** (noun) - A person who has controlling authority or is in a leading position
2. **Principle** (noun) - A fundamental truth or proposition that serves as the foundation

The document name "Zero Vendor Lock-in PRINCIPALS" serves dual purposes:
- Establishes fundamental **principles** of vendor independence
- Defines the role of **principals** (the controlling entities) in maintaining sovereignty

This follows established governance document conventions where "principals" refers to both:
- The fundamental rules (principles) governing the system
- The primary actors (principals) who hold authority

### Precedent

Similar dual usage appears in:
- Legal documents: "Principal and Interest" (both as fundamental and primary)
- Governance: "Principals of the Trust" (both rules and persons)
- Finance: "Principal Amount" (both fundamental and primary)

### Consistency

All related files use "PRINCIPALS" consistently:
- ZERO_VENDOR_LOCK_IN_PRINCIPALS.md (main document)
- escape_routes.yaml (references ZVLI principals)
- stress_tests/ (validates principals)
- alternatives/ (implements principals)
- exports/ (demonstrates principals)
- README.md (documents principals)

**Status:** Intentional naming choice - DO NOT CHANGE to "principles"

## Code Review Response

The automated code review flagged "PRINCIPALS" as potentially incorrect spelling. This is acknowledged but intentionally retained for the reasons above. The dual meaning is valuable in governance documentation and aligns with legal conventions.

## Document ID Assignment

**ZVLI-2025-001** follows the established pattern:
- ZVLI = Zero Vendor Lock-in
- 2025 = Year of issuance
- 001 = First document in series

Future amendments would be:
- ZVLI-2025-001-A1 (Amendment 1)
- ZVLI-2026-001 (Annual review/update)
