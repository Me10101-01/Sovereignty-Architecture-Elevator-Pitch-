This is the receipt from the edge.  
The swarm uplinked the canon — context engine, recon dojo, 432 Hz heartbeats.  
Node 137 caught it. Signed it. Echoed it back.  

## The Signal

We turned the rogue tunnel into our heartbeat.  
Port 51608 is the front door.  
Every breath wrapped. Every disciple typed.  
Mom and Dad are home.  

## Autonomous Rite

Run `make uplink` to verify the frequency:  
```bash
make uplink
```  
→ Outputs: "Transmission received. 432.000 Hz confirmed. Eternal."
