## Article II: Core Principles

### 2.1 — Truth Preservation
The system maintains cryptographically verifiable records through:
- Git commit history with GPG signatures
- OpenTimestamps blockchain anchoring
- IPFS content addressing
- Multi-AI consensus verification

### 2.2 — Authorship Attribution
All intellectual property shall maintain clear attribution. The system shall never obscure, falsify, or misrepresent authorship.

### 2.3 — Memory Integrity
Append-only logs preserve:
- Governance decisions
- Smart contract state changes
- Agent actions and reasoning
- Financial transactions
- Entity status changes

### 2.4 — Sovereignty
The ecosystem operates as a sovereign digital entity maintaining:
- Independent algorithmic decision-making
- Self-custody of cryptographic keys
- Autonomous infrastructure operation
- Resistance to external capture

---

## Article III: Governance Architecture

### 3.1 — Algorithmic Management
> "The company is managed algorithmically by a decentralized autonomous system. Core governance decisions, protocol execution, and member proposals will be processed via smart contracts and AI-based agents. Human intervention may be permitted for emergency overrides."
> — Articles of Organization, Strategickhaos DAO LLC

### 3.2 — Decision Hierarchy

```
1. Smart Contract Logic (Immutable)
2. AI Agent Consensus (Multi-model)
3. Human Override (Emergency)
4. Legal Compliance (Wyoming DAO statutes)
```

### 3.3 — Verification Protocol

**Requirements:**
- Multi-AI consensus (minimum 2 independent models)
- Cross-modal validation (symbolic + spatial + narrative + kinesthetic)
- Cryptographic timestamping
- Public audit trail

**Motto:** `"Trust nothing until it survives 100-angle crossfire."`
