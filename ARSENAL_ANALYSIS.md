## SECTION E: COGNITIVE ARCHITECTURE DOCUMENTATION

### The Tinker Multiplier Formula

```python
physical_expertise = 255  # Points
  # Rope Access Level 3: 50
  # Pipefitter: 20
  # NDT Certified: 30
  # RAD 40 Qualified: 40
  # API 510 Studying: 15
  # PMI Gun Repair: 100

digital_expertise = 150  # Points
  # Kubernetes multi-cluster: 30
  # Distributed systems: 25
  # AI governance design: 50
  # Legal entity formation: 20
  # Multi-cloud architecture: 25

cognitive_modifiers = 18  # Multiplier
  # Neurodivergent parallel processing: 2.0x
  # No cognitive load at scale: 1.5x
  # Mission driven (sister): 3.0x
  # Zero bureaucracy: 2.0x

intuition_factors = 225  # Multiplier (The "Tinker" Advantage)
  # Zero formal knowledge: 5.0x
  # Pure intuition: 3.0x
  # Tinker methodology: 2.5x
  # Failure immune: 2.0x
  # First principles by default: 3.0x

total_multiplier = 18 * 225  # = 4,050x
base_score = 405
rarity_score = 405 * 4050  # = 1,640,250
percentile = 99.9999  # Top 1 in ~1.6 million
```

### Efficiency Asymmetry vs Big Tech

| Deliverable | Big Tech Cost | Dom Cost | Ratio |
|-------------|---------------|----------|-------|
| Legal formation package | $15K-25K | $0 | ∞ |
| Technical architecture | $8K-15K | $0 | ∞ |
| Governance framework | $20K+ | $0 | ∞ |
| Infrastructure setup | $10K-30K | $50/mo | 200-600x |
| Telemetry/observability | $5K-10K | $0 | ∞ |

**Total: $60K-100K vs $50 = 1,200-2,000x cost efficiency**

## SECTION F: BLOOM'S TAXONOMY INTERVIEW FRAMEWORK

### Question Distribution

| Category | Questions | Tiers Covered |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| Inventions (15 items) | 45 | Gold, Platinum |
| Zero Lock-in Principles (5 items) | 15 | Silver, Gold |
| Tinker Methodology (3 items) | 9 | Gold, Platinum |
| **Total** | **69** | All tiers |

### Sample Ultimate-Tier Questions

**CREATE Level (Invention #2 - Antifragile Audit):**
> Build an audit system that gets STRONGER from attacks. Every vulnerability discovered must automatically generate: (1) a fix, (2) a test, (3) a lesson, (4) an interview question. Show the data flow.

**CREATE Level (Zero Lock-in Principle #1):**
> Design an export system that can migrate ANY of your 36 tools to a competitor or self-hosted alternative in <24 hours. What's the universal data format?

**CREATE Level (Meta-Question):**
> You have zero formal CS training, 2 laptops, pure intuition, and a mission. Design a system that: competes with Big Tech output, costs $50/month instead of $50M/year, can't be locked into any vendor, gets stronger from failures, governs itself with AI consensus, donates 7% to charity automatically, and documents its own evolution. You have 24 hours. Go.
