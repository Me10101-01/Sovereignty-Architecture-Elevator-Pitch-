      name: "Multi-AI Consensus Protocol"
      nft_tier: "PLATINUM"
      questions:
        create: >
          Design a voting mechanism where 5 AI models with different
          architectures must reach consensus on a code deployment, but
          one model (Qwen) runs locally and has 200ms latency advantage.
          How do you prevent the local model from dominating decisions?
        evaluate: >
          Your AI board voted 4-1 to deploy a feature. The dissenting AI
          (Grok) flagged a chaos scenario that the others dismissed. Two
          weeks later, that exact scenario causes an outage. Defend or
          critique your consensus threshold.
        analyze: >
          Decompose the failure modes of a 5-AI governance board.
          Which is more dangerous: false consensus (everyone agrees
          wrongly) or deadlock (no one agrees)?

      name: "Antifragile Audit System"
      nft_tier: "GOLD"
      questions:
        create: >
          Build an audit system that gets STRONGER from attacks. Every
          vulnerability discovered must automatically generate: (1) a fix,
          (2) a test, (3) a lesson, (4) an interview question. Show the
          data flow.
        evaluate: >
          Compare: traditional vulnerability scanning (find and fix) vs.
          Antifragile Audit (find, fix, learn, monetize via NFT). Which
          produces better long-term security posture? Justify with
          specific metrics.
        analyze: >
          Your antifragile audit found 188 errors in a Codespace session.
          Trace the causality chain from root cause to final resolution.
          What made this "antifragile" vs. just "debugging"?

    - id: INV-003
      name: "Empire DNA Evolution Tracker"
      nft_tier: "GOLD"
      questions:
        create: >
          Design a system that treats your entire infrastructure as a
          living organism with "chromosomes" (services), "fitness scores"
          (uptime/latency), and "mutations" (deployments). How do you
          implement natural selection for services?
        evaluate: >
          Your Empire DNA shows Service A has 99.99% uptime but consumes
          80% of resources. Service B has 95% uptime but uses 5%
          resources. Using evolutionary principles, which should
          "reproduce" (scale up)?
        analyze: >
          Map the genotype (code) to phenotype (behavior) relationship in
          your Empire DNA model. How do environmental pressures (traffic
          spikes) cause adaptation?

    - id: INV-004
      name: "Moonlight Session Agent"
      nft_tier: "GOLD"
      questions:
        create: >
          Design an agent that can reconstruct your cognitive state from:
          (1) browser tabs, (2) terminal history, (3) file modifications,
          (4) git commits. The agent should answer "what was I thinking at
          3am last Tuesday?"
        evaluate: >
          Your Moonlight agent recorded a 12-hour session with 847 file
          changes. It claims you were "exploring Kubernetes networking."
          But you remember "debugging DNS." How do you evaluate the
          agent's interpretation accuracy?
        analyze: >
          Deconstruct the difference between "session recording" and
          "cognitive state reconstruction." What data is necessary vs.
          sufficient to recreate intent?

    - id: INV-005
      name: "QueenNode SSH Gateway"
      nft_tier: "GOLD"
      questions:
        create: >
          Design a single point of entry to 4 heterogeneous nodes that
          handles key rotation, logs all sessions, and survives any single
          node failure.
        evaluate: >
          Your QueenNode is a single point of entry (good for control)
          and single point of failure (bad for availability). Justify
          this architectural tradeoff or propose an alternative.
        analyze: >
          Decompose the attack surface of a centralized SSH gateway vs.
          distributed direct access. Which threat model is QueenNode
          optimized for?

    - id: INV-006
      name: "Zero-Knowledge Proof Deployment"
      nft_tier: "GOLD"
      questions:
        create: >
          Design a deployment pipeline where you can prove code passed
          all tests without revealing the test suite or results to the
          deployment platform.
        evaluate: >
          Your ZK deployment system adds 2 minutes to every deploy.
          Traditional CI/CD takes 30 seconds. At what trust boundary
          does the tradeoff become worth it?
        analyze: >
          Decompose the information leakage in traditional CI/CD logs.
          What secrets are exposed that ZK proofs would protect?

    - id: INV-007
      name: "Chaos Injection Framework"
      nft_tier: "GOLD"
      questions:
        create: >
          Design a chaos system that automatically injects failures
          during deployments but learns which failures are "educational"
          vs. "destructive."
        evaluate: >
          Your chaos system crashed production 3 times but discovered
          5 critical resilience gaps. Was this acceptable? Define your
          acceptable chaos budget.
        analyze: >
          Decompose the difference between chaos engineering and
          traditional testing. What types of failures can only be
          discovered through chaos?

    - id: INV-008
      name: "Cognitive Load Monitor"
      nft_tier: "GOLD"
      questions:
        create: >
          Design a system that measures developer cognitive load from:
          context switches, decision complexity, interruptions, and
          parallel task management. Output a "brain capacity %" metric.
        evaluate: >
          Your cognitive monitor shows 95% capacity during a critical
          incident. Should the system auto-escalate or trust the operator?
          Defend your threshold.
        analyze: >
          Decompose cognitive load into: working memory usage, decision
          fatigue, context switching cost, and emotional regulation.
          Which is most predictive of errors?

    - id: INV-009
      name: "Self-Documenting Architecture"
      nft_tier: "GOLD"
      questions:
        create: >
          Design a system where every deployment automatically updates
          architecture diagrams, API docs, and runbooks. The documentation
          cannot drift from reality.
        evaluate: >
          Your self-documenting system generates 1000 pages of docs.
          Manual docs had 50 pages. Which is more useful? Define
          "documentation quality."
        analyze: >
          Decompose the documentation decay problem. Why do docs drift
          from code? What enforcement mechanisms prevent drift?

    - id: INV-010
      name: "Mutation Testing Framework"
      nft_tier: "GOLD"
      questions:
        create: >
          Design a testing system that deliberately breaks your code
          in subtle ways to verify your tests catch the mutations.
          Score test suite quality as % of mutations detected.
        evaluate: >
          Your mutation tests show 60% detection rate. Industry average
          is 40%. Is 60% good enough? What's the cost of reaching 90%?
        analyze: >
          Decompose test quality into: coverage, mutation score, edge
          case handling, and failure clarity. Which metric best predicts
          production bugs?

    - id: INV-011
      name: "Git Archaeology Tool"
      nft_tier: "GOLD"
      questions:
        create: >
          Design a tool that analyzes git history to identify: code
          ownership, blast radius of changes, technical debt accumulation,
          and refactoring candidates.
        evaluate: >
          Your archaeology tool recommends refactoring a 5-year-old
          module with 200 commits from 15 authors. Defend or reject
          this recommendation.
        analyze: >
          Decompose "code ownership" into: authorship, maintenance
          burden, domain knowledge, and accountability. Which matters
          most for quality?

    - id: INV-012
      name: "Cost Attribution System"
      nft_tier: "GOLD"
      questions:
        create: >
          Design a system that traces every cloud dollar to: feature,
          team, user session, and business outcome. Make waste visible
          and actionable.
        evaluate: >
          Your cost system shows Feature X costs $10k/month but generates
          $100k revenue. Feature Y costs $1k but generates $50k. Which
          deserves optimization first?
        analyze: >
          Decompose cloud cost into: compute, storage, network, and
          waste. Which category has the highest ROI for optimization?

    - id: INV-013
      name: "Contract Testing Protocol"
      nft_tier: "GOLD"
      questions:
        create: >
          Design a testing approach where service contracts are versioned,
          validated, and enforced automatically. Breaking changes must
          be explicitly acknowledged.
        evaluate: >
          Your contract tests block 30% of deployments for "breaking
          changes." Developers complain it's too strict. Defend or
          adjust your policy.
        analyze: >
          Decompose API versioning strategies into: URL-based, header-based,
          content-negotiation, and contract-based. Which prevents the
          most production incidents?

    - id: INV-014
      name: "Observability-Driven Development"
      nft_tier: "GOLD"
      questions:
        create: >
          Design a development workflow where observability (metrics,
          logs, traces) is written BEFORE code. Tests verify observability
          exists.
        evaluate: >
          Your team writes observability first. Development velocity
          drops 15% but production incidents drop 60%. Is this trade
          worth it?
        analyze: >
          Decompose observability into: telemetry collection, analysis,
          alerting, and action. Which phase has the highest failure rate?

    - id: INV-015
      name: "Progressive Delivery Engine"
      nft_tier: "GOLD"
      questions:
        create: >
          Design a deployment system that automatically rolls out changes
          to 1%, 10%, 50%, 100% of traffic while monitoring error rates,
          latency, and business metrics.
        evaluate: >
          Your progressive delivery caught a bug at 10% rollout, saving
          90% of users. But the rollout took 4 hours vs. 10 minutes for
          full deploy. Optimize this tradeoff.
        analyze: >
          Decompose deployment risk into: blast radius, detection speed,
          rollback speed, and recovery cost. Which variable matters most?

          Design an export system that can migrate ANY of your 36 tools
          to a competitor or self-hosted alternative in under 24 hours.
        evaluate: >
          Your data export uses JSON. Your competitor uses XML. Your
          self-hosted uses SQLite. Evaluate the tradeoffs of mandating a
          single format vs. supporting translation.
        analyze: >
          Decompose "data portability" into schema, format, semantics,
          relationships, and history. Which layer creates the most lock-in?

    - id: ZVL-002
      name: "API Abstraction"
      questions:
        create: >
          Design an abstraction layer where switching from OpenAI to
          Anthropic to local Ollama requires changing one configuration
          value, not code.
        evaluate: >
          Your abstraction adds 50ms latency per request. Is this
          acceptable for portability? Where is the break-even point?
        analyze: >
          Decompose the "abstraction tax" for AI providers. What
          capabilities are lost when you unify GPT/Claude/Llama?

    - id: ZVL-003
      name: "Infrastructure as Data"
      questions:
        create: >
          Design infrastructure definitions that are pure data (not code)
          and can be translated between Terraform, CloudFormation, Pulumi,
          and Kubernetes manifests.
        evaluate: >
          Your infrastructure-as-data approach cannot express custom
          logic that Terraform modules provide. Is this limitation
          acceptable? Where do you draw the line?
        analyze: >
          Decompose infrastructure lock-in into: syntax, semantics,
          state management, and provider-specific features. Which is
          hardest to abstract?

      name: "Service Mesh Portability"
      questions:
        create: >
          Design a service mesh configuration that works identically on
          Istio, Linkerd, and Consul without changing application code
          or deployment manifests.
        evaluate: >
          Your portable service mesh sacrifices 20% of Istio's advanced
          features. Which features are worth losing portability for?
        analyze: >
          Decompose service mesh capabilities into: traffic management,

      questions:
        create: >
          Design a database abstraction that allows switching between
          PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite with zero application code changes.
        evaluate: >
          Your database abstraction prevents using PostgreSQL-specific
          features like JSONB operators. How do you balance portability
          vs. performance?
        analyze: >
          Decompose database lock-in into: SQL dialect, data types,
          indexing strategies, and operational tooling. Which creates
          the stickiest vendor relationship?
